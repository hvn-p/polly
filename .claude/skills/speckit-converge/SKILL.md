# Speckit Converge Skill

## Polly rules for this step

`converge` judges the feature finished, seen from the outside. The Spec Kit check
below is only the first of seven steps; the six others come after it, in the
"Rest of the convergence" section.


## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before convergence)**:

- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_converge` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, do not skip silently: tell the user that `.specify/extensions.yml` could not be read (include the parser error) and that no hooks were checked, including any mandatory (`optional: false`) hooks registered there, then continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing command invocations from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` → `/speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):

    ```text
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```

  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):

    ```text
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Goal.
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.

- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Goal

Close the gap between what a feature's specification, plan, and tasks call for and what the
codebase currently implements. Read `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` as the **sole
source of intent** (with the constitution as governing constraints), assess the current
state of the code, determine which requirements, acceptance criteria, plan decisions, and
existing tasks are unmet, incomplete, or only partially satisfied, and **append each piece
of remaining work as a new, traceable task** at the bottom of `tasks.md` so that
`/speckit-implement` can complete it. This command MUST run only after
`/speckit-implement` has run on the current `tasks.md`, and after `/speckit-tasks` has produced a complete `tasks.md`.

This is **not** a diff tool and does **not** track changes. It assesses the present state
of the code relative to the feature's artifacts — no git, no branch comparison, no history.

## Operating Constraints

**APPEND-ONLY, NEVER REWRITE**: The command's **only** write is appending a new
`## Phase N: Convergence` section to `tasks.md`. It MUST NOT:

- modify `spec.md` or `plan.md` in any way;
- rewrite, renumber, reorder, or delete any existing task (including tasks from a prior
  Convergence phase);
- modify, create, or delete any application code — completing the appended tasks is the
  job of `/speckit-implement`.

When the codebase already satisfies everything, the command MUST leave `tasks.md`
**byte-for-byte unchanged** (no empty Convergence header) and report a clean result.

**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is
**non-negotiable**. Code that violates a MUST principle is the highest-severity finding and
produces a corresponding remediation task. If the constitution is an unfilled template,
skip constitution checks gracefully rather than failing.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Initialize Convergence Context

Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-spec --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:

- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md
- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md
- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md
- CONSTITUTION = `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (if present)
If `spec.md`, `plan.md`, or `tasks.md` is missing, STOP with a clear, actionable message naming the
prerequisite command to run (`/speckit-specify` for a missing spec, `/speckit-plan` for a missing plan,
`/speckit-tasks` for missing tasks). Do not produce partial output.
For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)

Load only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:

**From spec.md:**

- Functional Requirements (FR-###)
- Success Criteria (SC-###) — include only items requiring buildable work; exclude
  post-launch outcome metrics and business KPIs
- User Stories and their Acceptance Scenarios
- Edge Cases (if present)

**From plan.md:**

- Architecture/stack choices and technical decisions
- Data Model references
- Phases and named touch-points (files/components the plan says will be created or edited)
- Technical constraints

**From tasks.md:**

- Task IDs (to compute the next ID and next phase number)
- Descriptions, phase grouping, and referenced file paths

**From constitution (if not an unfilled template):**

- Principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements

### 3. Build the Intent Inventory

Create an internal model (do not echo raw artifacts):

- **Requirements inventory**: one stable key per FR-### / SC-### / user-story acceptance
  scenario (e.g. `US1/AC2`), plus the plan decisions and constitution principles that
  impose buildable obligations.
- **Code-scope map**: from the file paths named in `plan.md` and `tasks.md`, plus a keyword
  search for the concepts each requirement describes, derive the set of source files and
  components in scope for assessment. Bound the assessment to these — do **not** infer
  scope beyond what the artifacts define.

### 4. Assess the Codebase and Classify Findings

Include every existing task in the intent inventory, regardless of checkbox state or
Convergence phase: completion claims are not evidence. Verify current behavior against
the spec, plan, tasks, and constitution; for corrective task chains, assess the resulting
behavior, not superseded implementation details. Check both unmet obligations and
implementation that contradicts, exceeds, or falls outside the stated intent.

For each item in the intent inventory, inspect the current code in scope and produce a
`Finding` only where there is a gap. Classify every finding by **gap type**:

- **`missing`**: the required work is absent from the code entirely.
- **`partial`**: the work exists but does not yet fully satisfy the requirement /
  acceptance criterion / plan decision.
- **`contradicts`**: the code does something that conflicts with stated intent or a
  constitution MUST principle.
- **`unrequested`**: the code contains work not called for by the spec, plan, or tasks
  (surfaced for awareness — converge does **not** delete code, it only appends a task to
  review/justify or remove it).

Each `Finding` records: a stable id, the `source-ref` it traces to, the `gap-type`, a
severity, and a short human-readable description with the evidence (the file/area observed).

**Edge cases:**

- **Little or no code yet**: treat the entire specified scope as `missing` remaining work
  rather than failing.
- **Nothing remains**: produce zero findings and follow the converged branch in Step 7.

### 5. Assign Severity

- **CRITICAL**: violates a constitution MUST principle, or a `missing`/`contradicts` gap
  that blocks baseline functionality of a P1 user story.
- **HIGH**: a `missing` or `partial` gap on a core functional requirement or acceptance
  criterion.
- **MEDIUM**: a `partial` gap on a secondary requirement, or an `unrequested` addition with
  unclear justification.
- **LOW**: minor partial gaps, polish, or low-risk `unrequested` additions.

### 6. Present the In-Session Findings Summary

Before appending anything, output a compact, severity-graded summary (no file writes yet):

## Convergence Findings

| ID | Gap Type | Severity | Source | Evidence | Remaining Work |
|----|----------|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| F1 | missing  | HIGH     | FR-008 | Example: no append-only guard detected in path/to/module.py when writing tasks.md | Add append-only enforcement |

**Summary metrics:**

- Requirements / acceptance criteria checked
- Plan decisions checked
- Constitution principles checked (or "skipped — template")
- Findings by gap type (missing / partial / contradicts / unrequested)
- Findings by severity

### 7. Append Convergence Tasks (or report converged)

**If there are one or more actionable findings** (`tasks_appended` outcome):

Append to the **end** of `tasks.md`, per the append contract:

1. Scan all existing task IDs; let `M` be the maximum. Determine the next phase number `N`
   (highest existing phase + 1).
2. Write a single new section header `## Phase N: Convergence`.
3. Emit one checklist item per actionable finding, ordered CRITICAL/HIGH first, assigning
   zero-padded IDs `T{M+1:03d}, T{M+2:03d}, …`:

   ```markdown
   - [ ] T042 <imperative description> per <source-ref> (<gap-type>)
   ```

   `<source-ref>` traces the task to its origin: e.g. `FR-003`, `SC-002`,
   `US1/AC2`, `plan: storage decision`, `Constitution II`.

   `<gap-type>` is one of `missing`, `partial`, `contradicts`, `unrequested`.

   Constitution-violation tasks MUST be emitted first and described as
   `CRITICAL`.
4. Never reuse or renumber existing IDs. If a prior Convergence phase exists, add a new,
   separately-numbered one below it — do not touch the old one.

**If there are no actionable findings** (`converged` outcome):

- Do **not** modify `tasks.md` at all — no empty phase header.
- Report: **"✅ Converged — the implementation satisfies the spec, plan, and tasks."**
- Include the summary counts of what was checked.

### 8. Provide Next Actions (Handoff)

- On `tasks_appended`: state how many tasks were appended under which phase, and recommend
  running `/speckit-implement` to complete them; note that a follow-up converge
  run will find fewer or no remaining items.
- On `converged`: recommend proceeding to review / opening a PR. No further implement pass
  is needed for this feature's specified scope.

### 9. Check for extension hooks

After producing the result, check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.

- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_converge` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, do not skip silently: tell the user that `.specify/extensions.yml` could not be read (include the parser error) and that no hooks were checked, including any mandatory (`optional: false`) hooks registered there, then continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- Report the convergence outcome (`converged` or `tasks_appended`) in-session before listing
  any hooks, so users can decide whether to run optional follow-up commands.
- When constructing command invocations from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` → `/speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):

    ```text
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```

  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):

    ```text
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.

- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently


## Rest of the convergence

If the Spec Kit check added tasks, stop there: the next step is
`/speckit-implement`, then `/speckit-converge` again.

Otherwise, go on in this order, without changing any code (a finding becomes a task,
never a direct fix). Each review (steps 1 to 4) runs if it has never run on the
feature, or if the last note of `/speckit-implement` asks for it ("Reviews to rerun",
in `issue.md`). Otherwise it is skipped, and the report says so. The closing note of
`converge` names the reviews that ran.

1. **Code review**: `/code-review` at the level declared by the plan's "Review"
   section, without `--fix`.
2. **Test review**: `/baudrier:test-review` on the branch's tests, which reports the
   missing ones, the ones that protect nothing and the ones that would not see the
   behaviour break. The reason for each modified existing test, given in the PR
   description, is also judged at this step: missing or untenable, it is a finding.
3. **Security review**: `/security-review`, when the plan's "Review" section makes it
   mandatory.
4. **Design review**: Impeccable's finish review, for each interface the feature
   changes: the "Inspect and finish" section of the Impeccable skill
   (`reference/new-work.md`), its captures in the states that show the change, then
   the `impeccable-finish-reviewer` agent with that section's inputs (the surface's
   direction contract, the validated mockup or comp, the captures, the hook findings).
   Each material fix it returns is a finding, and so is a new design world without its
   `DESIGN.md`. No interface changed: skipped.
5. **Functional validation**: play the spec's scenarios through the real interfaces
   (browser on the web, local MCP), and put the evidence in the PR (screenshots in
   the state that shows the change, exchange with the MCP).
6. **Human validation**: present the feature to the user, open in the state that
   shows it, and wait for their verdict.

Each finding is added to `tasks.md` under a new "Convergence" phase, in the Spec Kit
check format (`<source-ref>`: `code-review`, `test-review`, `security-review`,
`design-review`, `validation`, `human`). It follows the path of its nature: a bug goes back through a
test that reproduces it, then the fix; a quality defect changes the code without
touching the tests; a missing or weak test is completed; a wrong plan goes back
through the spec and the plan first, then the tests.
Then send the tasks back to the PR description (`/speckit-issue-sync-push`), and
resume `/speckit-implement` then `/speckit-converge`. For functional and human
validation: after a small touch-up, revalidate what was touched; after a structural
change, everything.

The feature is "converged" only when none of the steps that ran finds anything more.

**Continuous improvement**: for each finding that could recur beyond this feature,
ask what would have prevented it (a check first, otherwise a rule in the nearest
`AGENTS.md`, otherwise nothing) and propose it. A rule whose cause has gone is updated
or removed.
